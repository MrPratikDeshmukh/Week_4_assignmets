    "Q1. What is Abstraction in OOps? Explain with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP). \n",
    "It is the process of hiding the implementation details of an object from the user. \n",
    "This allows the user to focus on the object's functionality, without having to worry about how it works.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's consider a Car class. \n",
    "The users of the Car class are interested in its basic functionalities such as starting the car, accelerating, and braking. They don't need to know the intricate details of how the engine works, the ignition system, or the internal mechanics. \n",
    "By abstracting away these implementation details, we can provide a simplified interface to the users, like start(), accelerate(), and brake(), which encapsulate the complex operations within the Car class. \n",
    "This way, users can interact with the Car object without being concerned about the internal complexities."

    "Abstraction is the process of hiding the implementation details of an object. Encapsulation is the process of bundling together the data and methods of an object.\n",
